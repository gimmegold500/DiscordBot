How to Run the bot

1. Download these files into a single folder
2. Run the command in terminal: pip install discord.py
3. In terminal enter: cd your\file\path\here\ (with your custom file path)
4. Open and edit the .env file in that path with the only line being 
    "token = yourtokenhere" and replace yourtoken here with your 
    discord bot's token which can be found on your developer portal
5. Run the command in terminal: python bot.py 
      (If you don't have python installed you might have to run pip install python)
6. Enjoy!
